# Demand Side Management in Smart Grid using Particle Swarm Optimization

## Problems we are addressing
- High peak load demand

- High distribution cost at peak load

- Load scheduling with consumersâ€™ consent

**_Solving these problems can be beneficial for both Distribution Companies(DISCOMs) and customers_**

## How Demand Side Management Solves Problem
Utilizing electricity tariffs, monetary incentives, and government regulations to :- 
- Mitigate the peak load demand
- Reduce overall distribution cost
- Maximize the use of renewable energy and battery storage

## Proposed Algorithm for Demand Side Management(DSM) using Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)

- It is a population based stochastic optimization technique
- Each particle contains records of their best fitness value, P_best, and the best fitness value of the entire swarm, G_best
- At each iteration we calculate fitness value of a bird and then compare it with Global P_best and G_best to update them if required.
- The swarm will move towards best solutions by minimizing objective function
